  description: New scattering regime map showing transition between independent/dependent scattering. Scattering coefficient is not the correct metric to draw demarcation line of the map. • Transport scattering coefficient used for establishing demarcation line. The vertical demarcation line at low size parameters is proven numerically. Refractive index affects the location of demarcation line.

  description: SSF estimates scattering coefficient and asymmetry parameter for dielectric particulate medium. Transport scattering coefficient is the proper metric for representing scattering regime. Solution of Maxwell’s equations is possible for finite sized particulate media. Coherent scattering leads to overestimation of scattering coefficient. Calculated asymmetry parameter depends on considered ensemble size.

  description: Necking in soot is considered for more accurate modeling of soot optical properties. Different necking models evaluated based on polarized light scattering measurements. Implementing necking is not sufficient to reproduce the measured scattering matrix. Predictions by different necking models with comparable aggregate volumes are similar.
